# Prolog Exercises
Those are the exercises I coded from the Logic Programming course in UoM (2019-2020)

Unfortunately, every PDF that is presented in this project is written in Greek. 
Thus, a brief description (in English) will be presented in the exercises and courseworks, if the title of the file is not straight forward. 
Despite that, PDFs have execution examples for the most of the tasks. 

## Exercises
The weekly exercises I had been doing during the 8th semester of my studies. 
Most of the exercises are a few lines. The beauty of Logic Programming. 

### Index of exercises
  1. Intro to the Prolog syntax

      - **Sum of lists:** The sum of every number in a list.
      - **Before last element:** Get the element that is presented before the last one.
      - **Occurs:** Find the amount of times an element exists in the list
      - **Count odds**
      - **Sum of even numbers**
      - **Replace**: Replace element X with element Y in a list and return the outcome.
  4. List advanced
      - **Sublists:** A few tiny functions with lists.
      - **Rotate left:** Rotate a list by N indexs.
      - **Common suffix:** Common suffix of two lists.
  5. Cut and higher order predicates
      - **Difference of two lists** 
      - **Union of lists:**  Union of two lists, but the common elements of the lists are only acquired in the second one. 
      - **Max:** Find max of a list.
      - **Unique element:** Return the unique elements of the list one by one.
      - **Map**
      - **Reduce**
      - **Intersect:** Keep common elements of two lists.
  6. Solution gathering and operators
      - **Less than 10:** Return the amount of samples that re less than 10.
      - **Set difference of two lists** (with the use of findall/3)  
      - **Minimum of list**
      - **Proper set:** Return Yes if there are no duplicates in the list.
      - **Map** (with findall)
      - **Model:** Create operators such as AND, NAND etc. and functions model and theory that return the possible combinations that return True.
  7. Graph search
      - **Ticket machine:** Modelization of a ticket machine. Returns every possible combination of coins that has an outcome of 50.
      - **Konigsberg's bridges**
  8. Constraints
      - **N Queen Problem**
      - **Balance lights:** Balance a bunch of lights (figure in the PDF). 
      - **Number generator:** Generate two numbers, with every digit used only once, to subtract to the coresponding outcome (in this case, the outcome is 12848 and some of the digits are already in use).
      - **Donald** (figure in PDF for more)
      - **Menu:** Combinations of dishes one can order, in the exact price is N.
  9. Element and Branch and Bound
      - **Worker:** The least possible cost for some supposedly jobs.
      - **Optimal number generator:** Generate two numbers, with every digit used only once and get the least possible output after the subtraction of these.
      - **Theses:** Get the best possible solution of the selection of these theses.
      - **Load trucks:** Get optimal solution for loading two trucks.
      - **Providers:** Get the best deal with the supposedly providers.
      - **Antennas:** Place the amount of antennas that is required, in such a way that every antenna has a different distance from any other distance between two antennas.
  10. Schedule constraints
      - **Museum:** Schedule visits of some groups in museum.
      - **Schedule reads:** Schedule reading of courses in the exams.
      - **Jobs:** Schedule jobs, while there are conditions for employees, order of jobs. 
      - **Tasks:** Schedule tasks with requirements about the order of tasks.
      - **Cars:** Schedule tehe crossing of a road.
  11. Set constraints
      - **Fair father:** Fair share of dowry (split into 3)
      - **Thiefs:** Share of the swag from a robbery. Yep, we did that. 
      
## Coursework
  1. Exec1
      - **Exclude list:** Return a list with every element that is not between the Low and High variables.
      - **Math match:** Returns every pair of elements that satisfy the correspinding function.
      - **Stack of blocks:** Get two stacks with 3 blocks each, that have the same height. Then, get the lowest stack possible.
  2. Exec2
      - **Split check:** Split a check into two, without the use of the digit 4.
      - **Schedule backups:** Schedule backups with respect to conditions like start time, duration and bandwith (weight) of the atoms.
      - **Arrange list:** Arrange list in such a way that every next jump is going to the index digit of the element. Ultimate goal is the loop of every element in the list, while every index has been visited.

This directory contains every lecture that was presented to the class. Unfortunately, these are is Greek too, but I will not get in trouble to translate them since they are huge.
